                </p>
                <p>
                  Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

                  <span class="article-bold">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</span>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
                </p>
                <a href="#" class="article-read-more about-me-page-font">Now I live the simple life</a>
                <p>
                  Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With how much it turned my life around, <span class="article-bold">I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it,</span> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!

                        Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy, you have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.

                    <p class="article-body">
                        Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance everything out.

                        A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
